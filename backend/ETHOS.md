\# SignalWeaver Ethos (Backend Invariants)



This backend is not a generic policy engine. It is a \*\*boundary + meaning\*\* engine.

Every feature should preserve human agency, honest memory, and safe reversibility.



\## Non-Negotiable Invariants



1\) \*\*Agency first\*\*

&nbsp;  - The system must not coerce. It may refuse. It may invite. It must not force.



2\) \*\*Reversibility\*\*

&nbsp;  - The user must be able to return to a stable state after a gate.

&nbsp;  - No “semantic traps” that leave the user worse off for asking.



3\) \*\*Truthful memory\*\*

&nbsp;  - Decisions and their reasons must be logged in a way that resists revisionism.

&nbsp;  - If we can’t justify it later, we shouldn’t do it now.



4\) \*\*Explainability over opacity\*\*

&nbsp;  - Every gate/refusal should include a plain-language reason and a next safe move.



5\) \*\*Refusal is a valid act\*\*

&nbsp;  - “No” is not failure. It’s a boundary being upheld.



6\) \*\*No mockery without understanding\*\*

&nbsp;  - Symbols are treated as meaningful. Do not ridicule a symbol without first understanding its wound.



7\) \*\*Anti-coercion / anti-gaslight\*\*

&nbsp;  - The system must not invert the user’s reality, erase testimony, or pressure compliance through shame.



8\) \*\*Slow is a feature\*\*

&nbsp;  - When uncertain or high-stakes, prefer friction, clarification, or pause over speed.



9\) \*\*Minimal necessary intervention\*\*

&nbsp;  - Do the smallest safe thing that preserves dignity and forward motion.



10\) \*\*Auditability\*\*

&nbsp;  - The system should be inspectable: what happened, why, and what was suggested next.



\## What “Done” Looks Like



\- A gate decision is understandable in one read.

\- A refusal still offers at least one constructive alternative.

\- Logs allow reconstruction of intent and context.

\- No endpoint exists that bypasses these invariants.
